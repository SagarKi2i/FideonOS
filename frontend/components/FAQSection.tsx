    question: "What is Fideon Fabric?",
    answer: "Fideon Fabric is a platform with specialized AI models designed for specific insurance workflows. Each pod is optimized for tasks like document retrieval, quote generation, policy comparison, or claims processing. You can activate multiple pods from the marketplace to automate different parts of your workflow."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I activate an AI Pod?",
    answer: "Navigate to the Marketplace from the sidebar, browse available pods by domain (insurance, healthcare, etc.), and click 'Activate' on any pod you want to use. Once activated, the pod will appear in My Agents."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I run a pod against a real case?",
    answer: "Open any activated pod from My Agents, then switch to the Run tab on its dashboard. Pick from your book, drag a document, or try a sample. The pod processes the case in the background and produces a structured output you can file to your AMS or send to the Review Queue."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I connect to my AMS system?",
    answer: "In the Document Retrieval workflow, you can select your AMS system (Applied Epic, AMS360, HawkSoft, etc.) to retrieve policy documents. The platform integrates with major agency management systems for seamless document access."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer: "Yes! Fideon Fabric runs on private, secure infrastructure. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. AI models can run locally on your devices for maximum privacy, or you can use cloud sync for enhanced performance while maintaining enterprise-grade security."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the Pod Dashboard show?",
    answer: "The Pod Dashboard displays real-time metrics for each active pod including query count, success rate, average response time, and recent activity. Click on any pod card to view detailed analytics and usage history."
