    "quote-generation": `**Quote Comparison Analysis**

Based on the quotes received from the selected carriers, here's my comprehensive analysis:

**Premium Comparison**
The premiums vary significantly across carriers, reflecting different risk assessment methodologies and discount structures. The lowest premium offers competitive pricing but should be evaluated against coverage quality.

**Coverage Assessment**
All quotes meet your requested coverage limits. However, there are subtle differences in policy exclusions and endorsements that could impact claims outcomes.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Best Value**: Consider the carrier offering the best balance of premium, deductible, and included features
2. **Claims Reputation**: Factor in each carrier's claims satisfaction ratings
3. **Bundling Opportunities**: Some carriers offer additional discounts for bundling multiple policies

**Risk Considerations:**
- Lower deductibles provide better out-of-pocket protection but increase premiums
- Multi-policy discounts can reduce overall insurance costs by 10-25%
- Consider each carrier's financial strength rating for long-term security

**Next Steps:**
Select your preferred quote and I'll generate a professional proposal ready to send to the insured.`,

    "policy-comparison": `**Policy Comparison Analysis**

Based on your request, here's a comprehensive comparison:

**Coverage Limits:**
• Policy A: General Liability $1M/$2M aggregate
• Policy B: General Liability $2M/$4M aggregate
✓ Policy B provides higher limits

**Deductibles:**
• Policy A: $5,000 per occurrence
• Policy B: $2,500 per occurrence
✓ Policy B has lower out-of-pocket costs

**Key Gaps Identified:**
⚠️ Policy A missing Cyber Liability coverage
⚠️ Neither policy includes Employment Practices Liability
⚠️ Policy A has water damage exclusion that Policy B covers

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider Policy B for better coverage limits
2. Add Cyber Liability endorsement ($50M-$100M coverage)
3. Review EPLI options for employment protection

**Summary:** Policy B offers superior protection with 25% higher premiums but significantly better coverage breadth and lower deductibles.`,

**SUBJECT:** Your 2026 Insurance Renewal - Action Required by Dec 15

Dear [Client Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding your upcoming insurance renewal, which takes effect on January 1, 2026.

**Renewal Summary:**

I'm pleased to share that we've secured competitive renewal terms for your coverage:

• **Premium:** $9,295/year (10% increase from $8,450)
• **Enhanced Coverage:** Liability limits increased from $1M to $2M at no extra charge
• **New Protections:** Added Active Assailant and Cyber coverage enhancements

**Why the Rate Increase?**

While a 10% increase may seem significant, it's actually below the market average of 15% for similar businesses. The increase reflects:
- Industry-wide loss trends affecting all insurers
- One claim from last year (water damage incident)
- Expanded coverage and higher limits included

**What Makes This a Good Renewal:**

✓ Coverage improvements worth $2,000+ provided at minimal cost
✓ Rate guarantee locked for 3 years if accepted by December 15
✓ No coverage gaps or compliance issues
✓ Same carrier continuity (no need to remarket)

**Action Required:**

Please review the attached renewal quote and let me know by **December 15, 2024** if you'd like to proceed. This deadline is important to secure the rate guarantee.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss coverage options, I'm happy to schedule a call at your convenience.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Review attached renewal documents
2. Confirm any business changes since last year
3. Approve renewal by December 15 to lock rates

Thank you for your continued trust in our agency. I look forward to serving your insurance needs in 2026.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
